This is a quick guide to help you with your first FFI steps with Gerbil.

The first thing to note is that FFI in Gerbil is actually delegated to
Gambit, where the mechanism to interface with C is known as the
[`C-interface`](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html#C_002dinterface).

We'll start our foray with a basic example: we are going to query for
the version of `glibc` on the current machine. The C code that achieves this:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gnu/libc-version.h>
int main (void) { puts (gnu_get_libc_version ()); return 0; }
```

We need to write a file module that will define and export an
identifier `get-glibc-version`. Subsequently, we'll import that
identifier and use it in the Gerbil runtime.

```
# Create a gerbil.pkg file for our project
$ cat > gerbil.pkg <<EOF
(package: myuser)
EOF
$ cat > libc-version.ss <<EOF
(export get-glibc-version)
(extern get-glibc-version)
(begin-foreign
  (namespace ("myuser/libc-version#" get-glibc-version))
  (c-declare "#include <stdio.h>")
  (c-declare "#include  <gnu/libc-version.h>")
  (define get-glibc-version (c-lambda () char-string "gnu_get_libc_version")))
EOF
```
File modules take their name from the including file, so this module
is named `libc-version` in the `myuser` package and as a result uses
`myuser/libc-version#` as the namespace prefix.

To feed code straight to the Gambit compiler from Gerbil we use the
`begin-foreign` special form. We namespace the identifier with the
package and module to adhere to the canonical namespace of the module.

We compile the module.

```
$ gxc libc-version.ss
```
We're now ready to use the module.

```
$ gxi
> (import :myuser/libc-version)
> (get-glibc-version)
"2.26"
```
Did you notice the compilation warning?

```
/usr/local/Gambit/v4.8.9/include/gambit.h:7262:32: warning: assignment discards ‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]
 #define ___CFUN_ASSIGN(r,val)r = val;
                                ^
libc-version__0.c:179:1: note: in expansion of macro ‘___CFUN_ASSIGN’
 ___CFUN_ASSIGN(___result,gnu_get_libc_version())
 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

That is because `gsc` doesn't have a `const` qualifier. We can work around it by replacing the original call with an equivalent call that performs  explicit casting. 

```
(define get-glibc-version (c-lambda () char-string "___return((char*)gnu_get_libc_version());"))
```

Et voilà, no more compilation warning!
